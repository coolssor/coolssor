# Hi! I'm Ross Coull
### I'm a professional with experience in IT Support, Web Design and Customer Service. In short, I love helping people!

Thanks for stopping by! I have an unwavering passion and energy for technology and design, and I've followed that passion in my work.

By day I'm an IT Services Specialist, meaning I deal with your IT issues you may be having. Whether it be you can't send emails, your VPN isn't connecting, or you can't get into your account, I'm always a phone call away from helping.

Outside of my regular work hours, I am a graphic and web designer, under the business name of Zenith. I love building beautiful visions and functional design, so what better thing to do than this?

So, that's a little about me. Wanna learn about what I've done in the past, or want to work with me? Keep scrolling!

Best regards,

Ross Coull
