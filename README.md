## who are ya?
i'm Ross Coull, an IT engineer out of Edinburgh. it's pretty nifty job. left school at 16, went straight into IT, been there ever since. i'd be fucked in any other career ðŸ¥²

you can check out my job history on linkedin. i've done a few things within IT, mostly as a frontline engineer handling day-to-day helpdesk tasks (on-premises and virtual), but now working in quality assurance
